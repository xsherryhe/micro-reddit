This project is a collection of back-end database structures and models needed to imitate some of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)'s most basic functions, namely link submissions and commenting. It is built using Ruby on Rails.

The project demonstrates basic use of Active Record models in Rails, including CRUD commands, database structuring, data model associations, database setup and migrations, and model-level validations.

This project is currently in progress.
